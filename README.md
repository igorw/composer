Composer - Package Management for PHP
=====================================

Composer is a package manager tracking local dependencies of your projects and libraries.

See the [about page](http://packagist.org/about) on [packagist.org](http://packagist.org/) for more information.

Installation / Usage
--------------------

1. Download the [`composer.phar`](http://packagist.org/get/composer.phar) executable
2. If you're on a \*nix system, make it executable: `chmod +x composer.phar`
3. Create a composer.json defining your dependencies. Note that this example is
a short version for applications that are not meant to be published as packages
themselves. To create libraries/packages please read the [guidelines](http://packagist.org/about).

    ``` json
    {
        "require": {
            "monolog/monolog": ">=1.0.0"
        }
    }
    ```

4. Run Composer: `php composer.phar install` (on \*nix you can omit the leading `php`)
5. Browse for more packages on [Packagist](http://packagist.org).
